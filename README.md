# Numerical-methods
This repo contains my notes and code during the Georgia Tech REU 2018 with Professor Molei Tao. Our research topic is numerical optimal control. I also include side papers that are relevant to our topic, though we don't actually use it during the REU.

## Project description
This project aims to devise a method to design an optimal spacecraft trajectory (minimizing energy needed for transfer). Since the spacecraft is governed by gravitational pulls from different objects in space and we want to minimize energy, the problem can be formulated as an optimal control problem. Since the system is too difficult to solve analytically, we test different numerical methods to solve it efficiently.

## Progress
From 05/2018 to 07/2018, I traveled to Georgia Tech to participate in Georgia Tech REU 2018. During those two months, I studied in depth about numerical methods, numerical stability, optimal control and Matlab programming (more details can be found in my report here: https://github.com/HoangT1215/Numerical-methods/blob/master/Reports/REU%20final%20report.pdf). Since this is a very exciting project, I continue to work on it after leaving the program.

This project is still in progress. While I have uploaded some codes here, most of them are from the REU and have not been updated since for confidentiality. If you wish to know more about the project, please contact me via my email.
